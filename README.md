# sound-level-monitoring-system

A real-time sound level monitoring system built using a Raspberry Pi and microphone sensor. The system tracks ambient noise levels and alerts a client device when the volume exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 80 dB).

## Key Features
- Real-Time Sound Monitoring using a microphone sensor.
- UDP Communication between server (Raspberry Pi) and client.
- Threshold Alerting when sound levels exceed a set dB level.

## Requirements
- Raspberry Pi with a microphone sensor.
- Python libraries: `sounddevice`, `numpy`, `socket`.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository(if viewing original):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khakanyiba/Sound-Level-Monitoring-System.git
2. Or download the code directly from this version.
3. Run the server on the Raspberry Pi and the client on a separate device to begin monitoring.
